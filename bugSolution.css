There are several approaches to solve this issue:

1. **Alternative layout:** If possible, avoid using `calc()` in such instances. Consider using flexbox or grid for more robust layout control that does not depend on precise pixel-based calculations.

2. **Unit consistency:**  Ensure all units within the `calc()` expression are consistently either percentages or pixels. For example, instead of `width: calc(50% - 10px);`, consider using a percentage based on the available container size (e.g., using JavaScript to calculate pixel values if necessary) or converting all values into a single unit (e.g., pixels). 

3. **Browser-specific fixes:** In some cases, browser-specific vendor prefixes or workarounds might be needed. But this should only be considered after trying the other approaches.  Always test across all target browsers. 

4. **Using JavaScript:**  If high precision is crucial and dealing with dynamic elements, consider using Javascript to calculate the width and then set it as an inline style or using a class.  This gives the most control, but is more resource intensive.
